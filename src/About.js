            <p>
                I'm a passionate software engineer looking to build cool projects that help people.
                While my background is in the biological sciences (entomology), I have found my innate curiosity,
                creativity, and problem-solving skills transitioned well into the world of coding.
                I began my coding journey in August 2019, and I haven't stopped since.
            </p>
